# CustomCreativity

A couple of notes:

1. Have over 500 lines of css for the page. I tried to add a variety of stuff: forms, flexbox, grid. I styled some buttons the same but kept some similar. 
2. I did check out Bootstrap (very cool). They had some example pages so I tried to mimic that with the Pricing options but writing my own CSS.
3. Focused on makeing it responsive
