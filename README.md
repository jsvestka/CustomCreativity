# CustomCreativity

A couple of notes:

1. Just googled some different cool site ideas and this is one that came up, so I just tried creating it myself. Tried to do some cool things (having the menu become a hamburger at certain screen size or copy input values to a new "Sign Up Page" but that seemed like it needed JS).
2. Have over 500 lines of css for the page. I tried to add a variety of stuff: forms, flexbox, grid. I styled some buttons the same but kept some similar. 
3. I did check out Bootstrap (very cool). They had some example pages so I tried to mimic that with the Pricing options but writing my own CSS.
4. Focused on making page responsive. Have several media queries in there to help. 
5. There's probably a better standard or more optimized way of writing the CSS so it's more consolidated. So let me know your thoughts on that.
6. Let me know if I'm using the div too much for the html tags and should be using more of the semantic tags.
